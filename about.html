        <h3>What's the point of this site?</h3>
        <p>Lifestyle Finance's goal is to make simple, convenient tools for
        the FIRE community to plan for financial independence.</p>
        <p>Our first tool, a simple FIRE timeline planner, is currently 
        available <a href="./main.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>It's our opinion that many FIRE-oriented sites today don't have
        an easy way to visualize all the possible angles of early 
        retirement - especially with tax sheltered accounts like 401(k)s 
        and Roth IRAs.</p>
        <p>Ever wondered, "How much income will I make from my 401(k) when 
        I'm eligible for it if I retire now?" Do you ponder what your Roth 
        IRA would grow into if you didn't contribute another dime? If so, 
        we've got the tools for you.</p>
        <h3>Why does the first table stop at age 59?</h3>
        <p>Age 59.5 is the point at which U.S. citizens can start drawing on 
        their tax-advantaged accounts without paying a penalty. Since this a 
        tool for people focused on early retirement, and it'd be a shame to 
        just throw money away to Uncle Sam, it's assumed that you'd be living 
        a carefree early retirement by age 59.</p>
        <p>That's why we wrote our second tool - a table for plotting income 
        from early retirement on to the point at which you are eligible to 
        receive income from your tax-sheltered accounts. You can find that 
        on the <a href="./main.html">same page as our first tool!</a></p> 
        <h3>Why is the default growth rate 7%?</h3>
        <p>Historically, the S&P has grown at about 7% annually. This is 
        averaged over a long period of time, however - over the short term,
        it's possible that the markets can fluctuate pretty wildly. This 
        tool is meant to give a ballpark approximation of when early 
        retirement is possible. Your own circumstances may vary.</p>
        <h3>Why is the default safe withdrawal rate 4%?</h3>
        <p>Inflation is a real thing - the trend is that, over time, prices 
        rise, and the value of a dollar shrinks. To compensate for that, 
        as well as adding some safety margin to your anticipated gains, the 
        default assumption is that, when FIRE'd, you only withdraw a maximum 
        of 4% of your account balance annually. Barring cataclysm, that will 
        have you set for life!</p>
        <h3>Are taxes accounted for in the income figures shown?</h3>
        <p>No, and that's an important consideration for you in FIRE, and a real 
        limitation of the tool.</p> 
        <p>We are working on a way to show both pre- and 
        post-tax income from both taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. Stay tuned!</p>
